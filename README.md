# SP8D Protocol Test Harness: Playwright E2E & Netlify CI Setup

## E2E Browser Coverage

- **Local:** Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Edge
- **Netlify CI:** Chromium, Firefox, Edge (WebKit skipped due to system dependency issues)

## Netlify CI Build Pipeline

1. **Skip Playwright browser downloads**: Set in `netlify.toml`:
   ```toml
   [build.environment]
   PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD = "1"
   ```
2. **Install Edge and system dependencies**: Handled in [`.netlify/build.sh`](.netlify/build.sh)
3. **Install Playwright system dependencies**: `npx playwright install-deps` (run in the build script)
4. **Build and test**: `npm run build` then `npx playwright test --config=playwright.dist.config.ts` (run in the build script)

## Netlify Build Script

All Netlify CI setup steps are automated in [`/.netlify/build.sh`](.netlify/build.sh). You do not need to run these manuallyâ€”Netlify will execute this script as part of the build process. For details, see the script itself.

## playwright.dist.config.ts

- In CI: runs Chromium, Firefox, Edge (no WebKit)
- Locally: runs all browsers
- Edge is run via the system-installed `msedge` channel

## Local Developer Experience

- `npx playwright install` is run on `postinstall` for local devs (see `package.json`)
- All browsers are available locally

## Troubleshooting

- **WebKit on CI:** Skipped due to system dependency issues on Netlify Ubuntu images. If Netlify updates their build image, you may re-enable WebKit in CI.
- **Edge on CI:** If Edge install fails, check Microsoft repo status and APT logs.
- **Playwright browser errors:** Ensure `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` is set in CI, and that you do not run `npx playwright install` in CI.

## Maintenance

- If you want to re-enable WebKit in CI, add it to the `projects` array in `playwright.dist.config.ts` for CI.
- Keep `.netlify/build.sh` up to date with any new browser/system requirements.
