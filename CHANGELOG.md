## [0.3.0] - 2025-05-24

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Fixes

- **Critical Memory Safety**: Added comprehensive bounds checking for slot indices and payload offsets to prevent buffer overruns and memory corruption
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Fixed atomic generation increment ordering to prevent ABA issues in slot state machine
- **Pointer Safety**: Implemented CAS-based head/tail pointer advancement to prevent lost updates in multi-producer/consumer scenarios
- **Buffer Validation**: Added comprehensive buffer structure validation in `fromBuffer` method to prevent crashes from malformed SharedArrayBuffers
- **Sweeper Race Conditions**: Fixed non-atomic slot reclamation in sweeper using CAS-protected operations

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Buffer Alignment**: Fixed buffer size calculation inconsistency between `createChannel` and `ChannelCore` constructor by creating unified `alignTo4()` helper
- **Timestamp Overflow**: Resolved timestamp wraparound vulnerability using `getMonotonicTimestamp()` method with `performance.now()` fallback

### ‚ú® Features

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added detailed error messages with context for protocol corruption detection
- **Monotonic Timestamps**: Implemented robust timestamp handling that prevents wraparound issues in long-running applications (>49.7 days)
- **Improved Diagnostics**: Enhanced error reporting and bounds checking for better debugging experience

### üèóÔ∏è Internal Changes

- **Memory Safety Architecture**: Established clear separation between core protocol safety (memory bounds, atomics) and application-layer features
- **Atomic Operations**: Enhanced all critical sections with proper CAS operations to ensure lock-free guarantees
- **Protocol Validation**: Added comprehensive internal state validation for protocol correctness

### üìù Documentation

- **Security Documentation**: Updated API reference with security considerations and best practices
- **Safety Guidelines**: Added documentation about memory safety guarantees and protocol correctness
- **Troubleshooting**: Enhanced FAQ with information about protocol errors and recovery mechanisms

### ‚ö° Performance

- **Zero Impact**: All security fixes maintain SP8D's lock-free performance characteristics
- **Minimal Overhead**: Added bounds checking and CAS operations have negligible impact on throughput
- **Maintained Guarantees**: Preserved sub-microsecond latency and zero-copy messaging benefits

### üß™ Testing

- **Comprehensive Validation**: All 24 test cases passing with enhanced security fixes
- **Race Condition Testing**: Validated fixes handle up to 1.4M conflicts correctly
- **High-Throughput Testing**: Confirmed 100% message processing under stress conditions
- **Memory Safety Testing**: Added validation for all bounds checking and overflow scenarios

### üö® Breaking Changes

None. This release maintains full API compatibility while significantly enhancing security and reliability.

## Migration Guide

### From 0.2.x to 0.3.0

No code changes required. This release enhances security and reliability without breaking API compatibility.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. Update your package.json to use `@sp8d/core@^0.3.0`
2. Run your existing tests to verify compatibility
3. Consider enabling diagnostics in staging environments to monitor the enhanced error reporting
4. Review the new security documentation for best practices

**What You Get:**

- ‚úÖ **Memory Safety**: Protection against buffer overruns and corruption
- ‚úÖ **Race Condition Prevention**: Bulletproof atomic operations
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Reliability**: Better error handling and recovery
- ‚úÖ **Long-Running Stability**: Fixed timestamp overflow issues
- ‚úÖ **Improved Debugging**: Better error messages and validation

The update is **drop-in compatible** and **production-ready**.
